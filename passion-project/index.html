		<h1>Our Moss Art Journey</h1>

		<p>
			Hi, I'm Kelly! During the pandemic, my partner and I discovered a
			shared love for moss art. It started as a way to stay grounded and
			express ourselves creatively. We never expected it to turn into
			something that would bring us so much peace, and eventually, into
			something we shared with others.

			<li>
				We use preserved moss â€” it's 100% real but needs no watering
			</li>
			<li>Moss art is relaxing to make and to look at</li>
			<li>Every piece we create is different and unique</li>
		</ul>
